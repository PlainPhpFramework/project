# The PlainPhp Project

Start with:

```composer create-project plainphp/project myproject```

This will create new a project in 'myproject' and automatically executes composer install to download all the dependencies.

Are you a developer? Run this command instead:

```composer create-project plainphp/project myproject -s dev --ignore-platform-reqs```
